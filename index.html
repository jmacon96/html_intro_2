      <h3>Setting Up the Environment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the atom IDE from <a href="https://atom.io/">here</a> </li>
      <li>Install these <a href="Atom Packages.pdf">packages</a> in atom </li>
      <li>Create a new web development folder somewhere on your computer</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML is the foundation of web development. This is the language that
         provides the structure and content of a website. A website can be
         created with just html, but it won’t be the most interesting website
         in the world as you will soon see.</li>
      <li>HTML has 2 types of tags (commands): <strong>self closing</strong> and <strong>non self closing</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A self closing tag is a tag that is enclosed in one set of brackets i.e., the tag does not have a corresponding closing tag. An example of a self closing tag would be &lt;hr&gt;, which adds a horizontal reference line.</li>

          <li>A non self closing tag is a tag that needs a corresponding closing tag. The effects of the tag will be applied to everything between the tag and closing tag. A closing tag is simply the tag with “/” added after the opening angle bracket. An example of a non self closing tag is &lt;h1&gt;Header Text &lt;/h1&gt; which creates a header with the text “Header Text”. If the tag isn’t closed, everything after the initial tag will have its effect applied. For example: &lt;h1&gt;Header Text &lt;p&gt;Paragraph will create a header with two lines. The first line is “Header Text” and the second line will be “Paragraph”, and both lines will have the h1 effects applied. This is not an error, and can be done intentionally to create headers with multiple lines. However, there is an obvious difference between the above example and this example: &lt;h1&gt;Header Text&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;. This example creates a single line header with the text “Header Text”, followed by a paragraph on the next line. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Look over <a href="HTML Basic Commands.pdf">HTML Basic Tags</a>  file. This document has everything you need to create your first website with usage examples. Remember that you can have tags inside of other tags.
        <ul>
          <li>
            optional: You can play around with the HTML tags at <a href="https://codepen.io/pen/">https://codepen.io/pen/</a> to see what the tags do in and experiment in a live playground environment
