      <h1>Create Your Website. Make It Look Like the Images Below. </h1>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="index.png">Index Image</a></li>
        <li> <a href="hobbies.png">Hobbies Image</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="contact.png">Contact Image</a> </li>

      <h3>Hints and Stuff</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Hint: The section with the picture and name / other information is inside of a table  </li>
        <li>Hint: The stars in the skills section are unicode emojis. They (and other emojis can be found <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/">here</a>  </li>
        <li>Hint: The <strong>My Hobbies</strong>  and <strong>Contact Me!!!</strong>  pages are links to other pages. You can create separate html files similar to index.html within your website folder. If you do this, you can replace the link to a website with the new file name. Refer to the <strong>HTML Basic Tags</strong>   document for the tag to create a link</li>
        <li>Hint: You do not need to recreate the Fun Stuff page. That was done for experimental purposes.</li>
        <li>Hint: The Skills Section is a little complicated, so it will be considered extra credit. Don’t worry too much if it doesn’t look right or if you only have half of the table (that was a minor hint) or if you don’t do it</li>
        <li>
        Hint: Everything under the horizontal rule on <strong>Contact Me!!!</strong> is part of a form. The smaller boxes are &lt;input&gt; with a type of text. The larger box is a &lt;textarea&gt; with the row and col size specified. Everything is in HTML Basic Tags. Don’t forget to include the &lt;form&gt; tag. </li>

          I will provide the code to my website for reference if you get stuck. It would be best for you to attempt to build it without looking at the code first.

          Be creative!!! Make your website to your liking

          To view your website, open the html file in your file explorer. It will open in a web browser. Note that this is only a local website and you no one else will be able to visit it.
