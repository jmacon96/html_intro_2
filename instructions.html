    <h2>Creating Your Website<hr></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new folder in your web development folder for this website.</li>
      <li>Inside atom, navigate to your website folder and create a new file named index.html. This will be your home page.</li>
      <li>If you installed all of the packages in atom listed above you can just type html and press enter in atom to create the html boilerplate code. If you didn’t or that didn’t work, I will provide the boilerplate code as well. The boilerplate code is a skeleton that contains everything you need to create a html page (minus the code to add content of course).
      <ul>
        <li>In the boilerplate code, there will be a &lt;head&gt; tag with a &lt;title&gt; tag inside. Inside of the &lt;title&gt; will be whatever you want to name your website (maybe something like My Website). This title will appear on the tab in your browser when you open your website. </li>
        <li>There will also be a &lt;body&gt; tag in the boilerplate. This is where the code for the content of your website will go.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
