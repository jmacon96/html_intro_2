    <h1>Applying CSS to Your Website</h1>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>
          This will be done by utilizing external CSS. In other words, the CSS code will go in a separate file within the website folder. You will have to link the CSS code to every file in your website. This will apply the CSS code to every instance of each element specified in the file
      </li>
      <li>
        In your website folder, create a new folder named <strong>css</strong> . Within the <strong>css</strong> folder, create a new file named styles.css.
      </li>
      <li>
        To link <strong>styles.css</strong>  to your html code, you would need to add this line to the head section of each html file after the title: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"&gt;. (The href address will need to be altered if you named the folder or file a different name)
      </li>
      <li>
        In styles.css add some color to some of the elements in your website. Feel free to free style it or if you want to look at color palettes go <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">here</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify the &lt;hr&gt; elements as well to add some extra styling go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style">here</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        My code is included, so if you get stuck, you can look at it. My files that have the CSS applied end in CSS.
